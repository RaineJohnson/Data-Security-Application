This project demonstrates uses of secure software engineering for a basic school database set up on a simulated server. It deals with properly assigning all relevent roles, as well as ensuring sensitive information isn't stored directly within the readable code. All of the student and teacher data is held within the data folder, and the database-api.js file handles all of the data and the surrounding logic. In this example project, the .gitignore file is not included so you can see how I set up the server and the rolls, along with storing the API keys in enviroment variables rather than directly in the code. Normally you absolutely must exclude these from a public repository, but for the sake of demonstration I'm keeping them in here. The .gitignore file should include the .env, pg_hba.conf, and the postgresql.conf files in a serious application setting as we don't want this information to be public.
